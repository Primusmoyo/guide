<!-- I do not know what I am doing here. All I know is that I did as directed in the lesson and the "run tests" tab was not returning the required result. When I ask for a hint, I get  a message that says "This is a stub". Now  I am stuck in one lesson and I do not even know what a stub is. I am learning coding for the first time and I think free code camp can do without these unnecessary complications for newbies like me. It is frustrating and there seems to be noone to help me. All I wanted to do is to learn to code.  -->
